Just my codestyle I'm not saying it's the only right or something. There's no right codestyles. But if you edit Programmer progs, you should follow Programmer's codestyle
I just start writing it, it's probably incomplete or inaccurate.

Class
PublicSomething
privateSomething
_ConstantSomething //or readonly or just that not changed more than 1 time.
_GlobalVariable
innerVariable
FuncArgument
tinyArg //tiny func args. For super-basic funcs, I mostly put them in Titanium.cs
o //this func arg or arg that will be returned. Named as type (s for string etc.)

other codestyle things are obvious through the code
